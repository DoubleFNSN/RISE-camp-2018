    "- This first notebook shows how easy is to use Flor for lightweight versioning and tracking of ML/AI experiments. \n",
    "- Our second notebook will show us how Flor aids with collaboration, by reusing an existing Flor pipeline and integrating into a new task\n",

    "\n",
    "A well-annotated experiment is easier to find and interpret, and a versioned experiment is easier to share and reproduce. In this part, we're going to show you how Flor can help systematize the annotating and versioning of alternatives you try in the process of training models."

We have kept a proper \"scientific notebook\" of all our experiments. This is important for rigorous work that enables experimental reproducibility, bias elimination, and mutual interpretation of results across team members and time. For example, anyone who views this notebook will know what data, modeling techniques and parameters we tried, and how they may have affected our choice of the final model (and the decision it eventually makes!) \n",
