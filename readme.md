# About
This repo contains the materials gathered from Berkley Rise camp.

# Quick description of each event/product:
* Ray: Distributed framework for executing python codes (you can split tasks to multiple cpu/gpu or even node)
* Ray Tune: Helps scale model training. its a framework for hyperparameter search.
* Clipper: Helps package models in container and allows serving this in scale.
* Flor: helps version control ML/AI experiments.
* PyWren: Allows you to execute python functions on aws lambda.
* Opaque: Encrypted dataframe for Sparks. (still alpha)
